Issues:
- line isnt accepted when first released was key(A or s) instead of mouse button
- black dots while animation is at 0% and 100%

Ideas:
- Instant render, no editor mode
- Brush tool - one click but with radius
- modifing parameters of tools(radius of circle, or width of "line")
- cpu version of Kernel
- fullscreen option loaded from configuration file
- Render one image
- Editing current group of points. [ Select, Move, Repleace, Delete]
- Parameter (lenth in pixel per one point). Possible to change while editing
- Change (lenth in pixel per one point) for current points (HARD)
- Simple adjusting images in editor. (change position, scale or angle of source images)

Todo:
- remove totalSize from KeysGroup (not used anywhere sice implemented Undo option)
- load path to configuration from parameter
- Friendly signalize of errors(cannot use gpu, cannot load file, etc.)
